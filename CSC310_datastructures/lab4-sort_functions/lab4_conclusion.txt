The insertion sort is faster, because it has a best case scenario of O(n) if the array is already sorted. The worst case is O(n^2), but if the array is even partially sorted it will be between O(n) and O(n^2).
Selection sort's best and worst case scenarios are both O(n^2), because it has to check every item after the current index to see if an item is smaller than the current one. 
This is why selection sort takes 28 steps, and insertion sort only takes 14 steps, making insertion sort faster.
